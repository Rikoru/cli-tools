# cli-tools
A variety of command-line tools

### Features
* It allows for the transmutation of text into interesting(?) shapes
* display help with `./cli-tools` or `./cli-tools -h`

### Roadmap
* A user will be able to save time doing silly things

### What are some example use-cases?
#### transmute wrap-box
A user wants to create a box of text, like so:
```
T E S T
E S T T
S T T E
T T E S
```
* This becomes inconvenient to do manually for larger sized boxes
* Can be done with `./cli-tools -Tw 'TEST'` or `./cli-tools --transmute -w 'TEST'`

### usage:

cli-tools {-T | --transmute} [options] <input>
options:
 * `-l`, `--lower` = Sets more to lower for applicable transmutations.
 * `-g` = Creates a gradient of the given input.
 * `-w` = Creates a wrapped box of the given input.
 * `-r` = Creates a left-ended right-angle of the input.
